# StudySorter
Basic study tracker I implemented just to see my university assignments and projects and what I should be working on

Currently just contains 2 classes
The main ToDoList class, and the Task class.

ToDoList class:
- Saves and loads tasks
- Sorts tasks by priority
- Completes (removes) tasks
- Views next task, or all tasks

Task class:
- Contains information relating to tasks such as name, grade worth, and due date.
- Formats the due date
- Calculates due date compared to current date to obtain priority
- Equals is based on task name
